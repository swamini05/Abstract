# Abstract
The ultimate aim of the online canteen management system is to automate the existing traditional system which is manual, with the support of computerized equipment, so that their valuable data can be retained for a prolonged period of time with quick access. The appropriate softwares are readily accessible and easy to use. There is a huge line in the institution canteen throughout the break. From the wait at the payment desk to the serving point, a ton of time is spent waiting for the food, because of which, students and the faculty get late for their lectures.  One way to resolve the issue would be to have a software arrangement in which, once the order has been put, it can be projected directly on the monitor . This will prevent out the time people spend at the payment desk as the server needs time to fulfill the previous orders before taking a fresh receipt and setting it up in the canteen. Even, we will put up the program to post orders in such a manner that his / her order is processed ready for the particular period that he / she prefers. The time wasted on waiting for change can also be diminished by enabling online payment through e wallet system. The project's main objective on System is to manage canteen, product, and sales information. It manages all the details of canteen, product, orders and users. The project is completely built at the administrative end and thus only admin is guaranteed the access. keywords:- online canteen management, e wallet
